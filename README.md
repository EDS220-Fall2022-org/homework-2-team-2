# EDS220 Final Project

## Exploring the Estimated Annual Loss Due to Natural Hazards in the US

#### Student Authors: Alex Reed, Erica Dale, Michelle Lam, and Wen-Tien Wang

## Objective 
This final assignment is a student led, data intensive analysis on a dataset our choosing.  Air quality serves as an important indicator of human health 
This notebook was composed for the "Working with Environmental Data Sets" course of "Environmental Data Science" (EDS 220) at the University of California Santa Barbara in Fall 2022. It provides an introduction to using National Risk Index (NRI) data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).The purpose of this project is to assess the estimated annual loss due to natural hazards affecting states acoss the United States. Historic and current data acquisition is important for planners, emergency managers, and other decision makers. With improved understanding of natural hazard risk, communities can take action to reduce the risk specific to that community. This data is made available by FEMA and is freely accessible. Data resources can be found here: https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources
