    "### Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to using National Risk Index (NRI) data. This data is made available by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and is freely accessible. The purpose of this project is to assess the estimated annual loss due to natural hazards affecting states across the United States. The notebook provides instruction and example code on how to pull in the NRI data directly from the source. Historic and current data acquisition is important for planners, emergency managers, and other decision makers. With improved understanding of natural hazard risk, communities can take action to reduce the risk specific to that community. The use case examples show how local governments and communities could plan based on the different natural hazards listed in the dataset."

    "<a id='overview'></a> \n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The NRI is a dataset and online tool to help illustrate the US communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards: Avalanche, Coastal Flooding, Cold Wave, Drought, Earthquake, Hail, Heat Wave, Hurricane, Ice Storm, Landslide, Lightning, Riverine Flooding, Strong Wind, Tornado, Tsunami, Volcanic Activity, Wildfire, and Winter Weather. The National Risk Index provides relative Risk Index scores and ratings based on data for Expected Annual Loss due to natural hazards, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. For this project, we focused on Expected Annual Loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coverage\n",
    "The states dataset spatially covers the contiguous US and Alaska. The extent used for searching include:\n",
    "West longitude: -179.2, East longitude: -66.9, North latitude: 71.4, South latitude: 18.9\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Format\n",
    "Data is in shapefiles accessed through .shp extension. The metadata “NRI_metadata_Novemeber2021” is an XML file accessed through .xml extension. The metadata was last updated on October 12, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sources\n",
    "Sources for Expected Annual Loss data include: Arizona State University’s (ASU) Center for Emergency Management and Homeland Security (CEMHS), California Department of Conservation, California Geological Survey, California Office of Emergency Services, Colorado Avalanche Information Center, CoreLogic’s Flood Services, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), Iowa State University's Iowa Environmental Mesonet, National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, State of Hawaii’s Office of Planning’s Statewide GIS Program, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), U.S. Forest Service's Fire Modeling Institute's Missoula Fire Sciences Lab, U.S. Forest Service's National Avalanche Center (NAC), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Geological Survey's Landslide Hazards Program, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), University of Alaska – Fairbanks' Alaska Earthquake Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln's National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), University of Southern California's Tsunami Research Center, and Washington State Department of Natural Resources."

    " - Assemble all of the data needed in your Github repo: Jupyter notebooks, a README file, and any datasets needed (these should be small, if included within the repo). Larger datasets should be stored on a separate server, and access codes included within the Jupyter notebook as discussed above. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
