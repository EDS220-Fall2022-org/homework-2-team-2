    "The National Risk Index (NRI) is a dataset and online tool to help illustrate the US communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards. It serves as a useful tool for planners and emergency managers at the local, regional, state, and federal levels, as well as other decision makers and interested members of the general public. With improved understanding of natural hazard risk, communities can take action to reduce the risk specific to that community. The NRI was designed and built by FEMA in close collaboration with various stakeholders and partners in academia; local, state and federal government; and private industry. "

    " - Assemble all of the data needed in your Github repo: Jupyter notebooks, a README file, and any datasets needed (these should be small, if included within the repo). Larger datasets should be stored on a separate server, and access codes included within the Jupyter notebook as discussed above. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
